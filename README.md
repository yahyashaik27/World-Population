# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on World Population

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on world population data. The analysis has been performed using Python's pandas library for data manipulation and matplotlib for data visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains historical world population data by country and year. It provides insights into population trends and distribution across different countries and continents.

## Analysis

In this EDA, I've focused on the following aspects:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries. Necessary data transformations were performed to make it ready for analysis.

2. **Population Trends Over Time**: I visualized the overall world population trend over the years. Using matplotlib, I created line plots to showcase the growth or decline of the global population.

3. **Population by Country**: I analyzed the population distribution among different countries. Bar plots were used to visualize the top populated countries and their relative sizes.

4. **Population by Continent**: I grouped the data by continent and explored population trends continent-wise. Stacked bar plots were used to show the distribution of population among different continents.

5. **Insights and Trends**: I derived insights from the analysis, identifying countries with the highest population, countries experiencing rapid growth, and continents with the most significant changes in population.

## Requirements

To reproduce this analysis, you will need:

- Python (version X.X)
- pandas library (version X.X)
- matplotlib library (version X.X)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:


## Usage

1. Clone this repository:


2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the analysis:


## Conclusion

Through this EDA, I gained insights into the historical world population trends, country-wise population distribution, and population trends across continents. The analysis helps in understanding the dynamics of population growth and its impact on different regions.
